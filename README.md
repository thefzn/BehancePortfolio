Behance Custom Portfolio
================

A Front-End-only Webapp that displays your Behance Portfolio on a custom responsive page.

###Usage
Just copy the code, host it wherever you want and access the index.html adding your Behance user as a search parameter (yourHost.com/index.html?searchParameter).

It is also posible to share the portfolio with an specific section opened by default by adding it to the URL as a hash parameter (yourHost.com/index.html?searchParameter#hashParameter).
